/**
 * Problem 27: String to Integer (atoi)
 * 
 * Implement the myAtoi(s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.
 * The algorithm for myAtoi(s) is as follows:
 * 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
 * 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'.
 *    Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively.
 *    Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
 * 3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached.
 *    The rest of the string is ignored.
 * 4. Convert these digits into an integer (e.g. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32).
 *    If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
 * 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1],
 *    then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be clamped to -2^31,
 *    and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be clamped to 2^31 - 1.
 * 6. Return the integer as the final result.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "42"
 * Output: 42
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "   -042"
 * Output: -42
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "1337c0d3"
 * Output: 1337 (Stops reading at 'c')
